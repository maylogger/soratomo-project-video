00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,850
Tokino Sora is a Japanese virtual idol who
loves to sing and dance.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,700
As a virtual YouTube star, she is an energetic
young girl

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,342
with a motherly attitude whose hobbies include
singing and dancing,

4
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:14,542
and a peculiar love for horror games.

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:17,745
Working under the entertainment agency known
as "Cover Corp,"

6
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:20,635
Sora is the picturesque representative of
Cover.

7
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:26,473
She and her peers are one of the most internationally
recognized groups of "Vtubers," called "Hololive."

8
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:32,860
Being its very first talent and thus its progenitor,
she was the one who carried Hololive on her

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,740
shoulders from day one.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,717
As such, she is a highly respected individual.

11
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:40,520
This reputation of hers was earned through
her contributions

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,050
as one of the pioneers of this vibrant industry.

13
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:47,329
Her emotional journey is filled with pride
and determination, and shows us that anything

14
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:50,787
can be achieved, even at your own pace.

15
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:54,660
Her grand reputation and achievements could
not come to be were it not for an exhausting

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,870
amount of hard work.

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,926
So who is Tokino Sora?

18
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:05,984
(piano riff from Heroic Heroine)

19
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,796
Virtual YouTubers are an entertainment phenomena
that was born in Japan,

20
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:23,024
which began sprouting in 2016.

21
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:27,960
This new phenomena features content creators
who use virtual avatars to represent themselves.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,255
The main medium used for their activities is
in their name: YouTube.

23
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:35,794
Permeating throughout Japanese entertainment
media, this new industry started

24
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:38,035
with the debut of Kizuna Ai.

25
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:44,048
Kizuna Ai was the first self-proclaimed Virtual
YouTuber who debuted on December 1st, 2016.

26
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:48,218
With her viral growth in early 2017, she paved
the way for the industry to come,

27
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:51,756
marking herself as the progenitor of modern
Vtubing.

28
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:55,780
Nowadays, the Vtuber industry features thousands
of different Vtubers,

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,267
each with varied styles of presentation, specialities,
and personalities.

30
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:04,271
There are gamers, singers, artists, programmers,
and more.

31
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:08,728
Among this diverse sea of virtual talent,
stands the star of our show:

32
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,200
Tokino Sora

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,350
A shy but cheerful girl with a grandiose
dream.

34
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,662
Sora began her entertainment career on September
7th, 2017

35
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:20,940
on NicoNicoDouga, a Japanese parallel to YouTube

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,000
By today's standard, when a new Vtuber appears
for the first time,

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,650
there is often a huge amount of viewership,

38
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,090
regarding it as something to be celebrated.

39
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,480
In the case of Hololive,

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,680
when new Vtubers debut, it’s common for
them to reach upwards of

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,400
hundreds of thousands of viewers and subscribers
for their very first stream.

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,327
By comparison, discounting any staff, Sora’s
first stream had thirteen

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,624
On October 19th 2017, as celebration for reaching
100 subscribers,

44
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:57,170
her model received a minor update.

45
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,351
Later, on Halloween, she received a new costume,
accessories, and an unnamed mascot,

46
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:03,936
who would later be named Ankimo.

47
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:07,780
Despite all these new changes, her subscription
count hadn’t noticeably risen.

48
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,659
A-chan and the staff considered giving up
livestreams altogether

49
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:14,062
in favour of YouTube videos but Sora refused.

50
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:18,239
Instead, she worked harder to improve her
livestream performance, exploring other platforms

51
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,420
like Line,

52
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,050
17live, TikTok, and focusing on conversing
with her audience and fans.

53
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,471
But what is an entertainer without her fans?

54
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:31,530
Sora’s slow but steady rise to popularity
garnered her a loyal fanbase,

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,746
which did not have a name to call themselves.

56
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:38,720
So on November 2nd, 2017, Sora hosted a poll
to see what name best suited her fans.

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,240
There were many suggestions like Tokitomo,
Sorabuds, Soragang and Soraves (slaves),

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,870
but one name stood out among the rest and
that’s how the name “Soratomo” was chosen

59
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,505
as the official fan name for her fans.

60
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:55,203
By December 23rd, 2017, Sora's subscriber
count reached 1,000.

61
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:59,640
It was a huge number for her, but meager at
the time when compared to Kizuna Ai and the other

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,425
Heavenly Kings.

63
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:05,918
However on Christmas 2017, a miracle occurred.

64
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:11,038
According to JP Soratomos, Dennou Shojo Siro
suffered technical issues mid-stream,

65
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:14,530
and while waiting for the stream to be fixed,
many decided to watch Sora instead

66
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,657
and were smitten by her charm and personality.

67
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:21,974
This boosted her subscriber growth and granted
her a significant increase in viewers.

68
00:04:21,974 --> 00:04:26,910
This abrupt rise shot her subscriber count
up to over 3,000 by the end of Christmas,

69
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,215
and skyrocketed her straight up to 20,000
at the start of 2018.

70
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:37,297
This sudden rise was quite the sight to behold
- truly, a Christmas Miracle.

71
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:41,389
With Sora’s rise in popularity we have yet
to know what drives her to be a Vtuber,

72
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,910
what makes her want to perform in front of
thousands of people.

73
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,896
So, what is her goal?

74
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:49,538
What is Tokino Sora’s dream?

75
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:53,437
On December 28th 2017, Sora explained that
when she was a child,

76
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:56,816
her mother brought her to a concert at Yokohama Arena.

77
00:04:56,816 --> 00:05:00,245
She told Sora that one day, she wanted to
see her daughter up there.

78
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:03,767
And from that day forward, Sora made it her dream
to have original songs,

79
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,967
and to one day be able to perform on stage at Yokohama Arena.

80
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:19,184
But to be an idol takes a lot of hard work and dedication.

81
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:23,688
Then, what challenges does she have in front of her, on the way to achieving her idol dream?

82
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:31,712
(ending portion of Kotoba Kaze)

83
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:41,288
After the Christmas Miracle, Sora's subscriber count continued to climb rapidly,

84
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:44,733
shooting up to 20,000 at the start of 2018.

85
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:47,816
To start off the new year, Sora had her first ever company collaboration

86
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:50,996
with MirrativQ on January 5th and the 17th.

87
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:52,635
She was the Emcee for the event.

88
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:54,797
It's MirrativQ time!

89
00:05:54,797 --> 00:06:01,374
The event was a quiz event, where viewers would participate via the Mirrativ app if they answered questions correctly.

90
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,725
This brand new opportunity was a spotlight for Sora,

91
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:07,285
which quickly turned the first step of her dream into a nightmare.

92
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:12,179
The event was plagued with endless technical problems and many viewers were unable to participate in the event,

93
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:14,688
or were disconnected halfway through.

94
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:20,000
The number of participants started at 446 then rapidly dropped down to 47.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,400
Losing around 90% of the participants was so alarming to the point that the event was almost called off.

96
00:06:26,397 --> 00:06:31,366
Fortunately, despite all the difficulties, one participant managed to answer all of the questions.

97
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:35,488
This Soratomo persevered and was dubbed “Leonidas”  by the fans.

98
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:38,363
The legendary deeds of Leonidas were forever immortalized

99
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:42,458
when Sora symbolically included them in her cover MV of Solar System Disco.

100
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:06,632
After the event, during an after-talk stream, she cried on stream for the first time.

101
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:09,832
This is something that she had promised never to show in front of her fans -

102
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:12,666
that she would never cry out of sadness, but only out of joy.

103
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:30,000
Inspired by Sora’s determination, some Soratomos decided to create a beautiful song for her,

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,393
and Sora released it as her very first soraSong, Yumeiro Asterisk.

105
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:38,874
An original song composed by a Soratomo with Sora’s image as their theme.

106
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:43,119
Sora’s popularity continuing to rise was a spectacle to behold that was nothing short of astonishing.

107
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:52,820
Described by A-chan herself, Sora was “the woman who swam too late to catch the big wave.”

108
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,895
Despite this, by March 2018, her subscriber count broke through another barrier,

109
00:07:56,895 --> 00:08:02,271
surpassing 100,000, in spite of criticism of being a “Kizuna Ai clone.”

110
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:04,826
With the support of her Soratomos, Sora endured,

111
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:08,514
promising to keep moving forward one step at a time and never stopping,

112
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:13,159
like a star shining in the night sky. A true idol…

113
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:20,461
On May 18th, 2018, Sora made her first transformation into an idol by debuting her idol outfit.

114
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:25,492
Achieving the first big step on the path to Yokohama Arena was a monumental and emotional event.

115
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:28,814
One could not help but cheer, watching Sora continue to grow.

116
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:32,136
But the road to becoming an idol is more than just changing a costume.

117
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:36,516
She would have to continue to prove her determination through her actions in the years to come.

118
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:42,035
Throughout 2018, she participated in various concerts including Rage Virtual Youtuber Grand Prix,

119
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:45,285
Nico Nico Cho Party (pictured), and Tubeout! Vol.1.

120
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:51,211
2018 was a great year of growth for Sora, with her idol activities only continuing to ramp up in 2019.

121
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:56,873
To kick things off, she made a special announcement that would mark a monumental point in her idol career.

122
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:14,193
Presenting herself as a Virtual Idol,

123
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:19,264
in March 2019 she announced a recording contract with one of the largest recording labels in Japan

124
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:21,345
Victor Entertainment.

125
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:25,000
Furthermore, she also announced her first album Dreaming.

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,115
This event uniquely placed herself as one of the few Vtubers with a recording label.

127
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,285
In April of that year, she starred in a TV drama named

128
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,168
Watanuki-san Chi no.

129
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:36,828
It’s a 2-season drama focusing on the lives of three sisters

130
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:39,880
living together in Tokyo after losing their parents.

131
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,873
Sora played the major role of the eldest sister, Watanuki Ichika.

132
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:46,381
This was the second TV show that Sora had a part in.

133
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:50,232
The first being Virtual-san wa Miteiru where she only got a minor role.

134
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:55,365
In addition to that, she also released her own light novel on April 29th

135
00:09:55,365 --> 00:10:00,091
titled Tokino Sora: Virtual Idol Dakedo Ouen Shite Kuremasu ka?

136
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:02,762
This LN tells the story of Sora in her early days,

137
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:06,400
the challenges and the struggles that she and her team had been through.

138
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,680
With all the big achievements that she garnered, she finally received her second major model upgrade on June 27th, 2019.

139
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,531
This new model made her look slimmer, more stylish, and more idol-like.

140
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:20,687
With this new model, Sora was ready to take on her first major step as a solo idol.

141
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,954
So on October 6th, 2019, Sora got to perform her first ever solo concert:

142
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:30,317
Dream! at Veats Shibuya.

143
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:35,290
Performing Hololive On Stage - DayDream in the afternoon the same day,

144
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,821
Sora's first concert followed later that night which was an amazing performance.

145
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:42,816
As the title portrays, Dream! was truly a dream come true,

146
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:46,606
and this would only be the first of many solo concerts that she would have.

147
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:50,000
2019 was one of the busiest and greatest years for Sora.

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,203
She was so busy to the point that it pushed her to exhaustion.

149
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:57,726
Yet despite that, she never stopped due to the support of her family, friends and fans.

150
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:07,970
On top of all the major events, she also collaborated with other Vtubers on the album Imagination Vol.1

151
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,655
while her cover song Alien Alien achieved a whopping 10-million view to date.

152
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:16,857
To top things off, she also reached 250k subscribers that year.

153
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:19,497
Although Sora has garnered many accomplishments that year,

154
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:23,531
the road to Yokohama Arena remained long with many challenges to face.

155
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:31,004
As the new year of 2020 began, Sora and the other Hololive members performed their first group idol concert,

156
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:33,593
aptly named Non-stop Story.

157
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:37,485
The concert took place on January 24th at Toyosu Pit.

158
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:41,749
The ending song that they used for the concert was one of Sora’s original songs - Dream Story

159
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:43,281
- but with a slight twist.

160
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:45,200
Its lyrics were slightly adjusted from

161
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:48,177
“Tokino Sora da yo!” to “Hololive da yo!”.

162
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:50,421
This edit was suggested by Sora herself.

163
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:55,836
Later that year, she also released a mini-Album: My Loving on March 4th

164
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:58,772
and also her first photo book titled SoraBiyori.

165
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:05,522
Things were looking good for Sora but as 2020 progressed, the world shook in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

166
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:11,375
This world-shaking event affected Sora, where some of her activities like streaming, had to be halted or delayed.

167
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,209
Even her birthday celebration stream was postponed.

168
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:19,606
In response to the pandemic, she streamed more frequently from home, and even did her very first guerilla stream.

169
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,074
This was a new experience for her because previously,

170
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:28,067
she mainly streamed from the studio with all the staff at her side since it’s easier for them to manage her idol activities.

171
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:34,339
On her 20th Birthday, she released Aozora no Symphony, a song she personally wrote for her Soratomos.

172
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:37,620
During an interview, when asked about her feelings about this song, she said,

173
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,939
It feels like I’m putting my whole self out there, it’s not easy to get used to.

174
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:46,746
I think it is a special song, containing both the happiness of having someone who is pleased by the song,

175
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:48,746
and the uneasiness of it.

176
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:54,367
The lyrics are totally plain, but I figured I should express how I felt to the greatest degree possible.

177
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:59,072
Being too honest might have its drawbacks, but I think if you’re living honestly, you can have a blessed life.

178
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,702
So on a fundamental level, I’m happy with who I am.

179
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:08,300
In June 2020, she celebrated her belated birthday alongside her alter ego, Yoruno Sora.

180
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,212
Unlike Tokino Sora, Yoruno Sora is a much more quiet version of herself

181
00:13:12,212 --> 00:13:15,493
where she has a much deeper voice and a more relaxed aura.

182
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:19,385
The song that “they” performed together was Instant Heaven.

183
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:23,648
Continuing on to September for her 3rd anniversary, she got another model upgrade.

184
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:27,362
This is undoubtedly her most popular and cutest model to date.

185
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:30,211
During the anniversary stream, her longtime friend and colleague,

186
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:32,705
A-chan wrote an emotional letter for her.

187
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:38,061
It had been a tough journey for them, but they did not falter and persevered until their hard work came to fruition.

188
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:22,756
In that same month, she also held a concert with AZKi, titled Setsunatik Chronicles,

189
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:26,078
alongside the release of their single Kurenai Chronicles

190
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:30,152
Sora’s popularity as an idol kept on soaring even higher

191
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:34,102
to the point where she even managed to cross through the barrier between "virtual" and "real".

192
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:40,615
Tokyo Idol Festival is an annual event featuring performances from idols and idol groups from all over Japan.

193
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:44,466
That year, they had decided to host their first ever online festival to celebrate

194
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,012
not only real world idols, but even virtual ones.

195
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:53,390
Sora was selected as their first Virtual Emcee from October 2nd to October 4th, 2020.

196
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,599
Needless to say, she did a spectacular job.

197
00:14:56,603 --> 00:15:02,325
After having hosted TIF 2020, she announced her second album On Stage! on October 21st.

198
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:05,112
This signified another big step towards her dream.

199
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:08,906
The album is packed with her feelings and memories with her Soratomos,

200
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:11,435
showcasing not just her desire to realize her dream,

201
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:14,228
but to stand together with everyone who had supported her along the way.

202
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:19,419
Soon after the album's release, she also performed her 2nd Solo concert Parallel Time.

203
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:22,998
Parallel Time was performed exclusively online through SPWN.

204
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:27,978
It was an emotional and energetic event which showcased the culmination of Sora’s past 3 years;

205
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:31,442
her experience, her talents, her skills, were all showcased here.

206
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:37,820
The pandemic had halted many operations across many industries but for Sora, that didn’t stop her.

207
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:42,893
Since people were pressured into staying at home or in isolation, the consumption of digital entertainment had increased.

208
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:47,778
This rising desire for entertainment lifted all Vtubers to boom in popularity.

209
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:51,550
As a result, Hololive and the Vtuber industry grew dramatically,

210
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,970
with Sora herself reaching 500,000 subscribers on October 26th, 2020,

211
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,418
doubling her subscribers from the previous year.

212
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:01,484
Sora had the will and perseverance to achieve her dream.

213
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:06,861
She always pushes herself to be an idol everyone can be proud of, being a beacon of hope and inspiration.

214
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:12,401
By 2021, Sora had reached heights that she couldn’t even have imagined when she first started.

215
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:18,389
On November 2021, she released her third album Re:Play , which primarily consists of cover songs.

216
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:23,481
This album is filled with songs that she’s interested in or already used to singing during her karaoke streams.

217
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:27,091
When asked about her thoughts on the album, she mentioned that it was a nice change of pace

218
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:31,552
for her since she was always interested in making an album full of cover songs at least once.

219
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:37,101
Throughout that year, there was a lot of merchandise being made in her image, like plushies and ceramic dolls.

220
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:41,725
She was even made into cards for TCGs (Trading Card Games), such as Rebirth and Weiss Schwarz.

221
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:48,350
Furthermore, she was also selected as the representative of VTubers for the 18th Tokyo International Music Market.

222
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,684
And finally, she unveiled her first casual attire on March 3rd,

223
00:16:51,684 --> 00:16:56,471
which she had been lacking for a long time since all her major outfits thus far were idol costumes.

224
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,388
We are witnessing Sora’s growth as a Vtuber, but more importantly, as an IDOL, and her journey is far from over.

225
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:08,595
There are so many Vtubers with a variety of gimmicks, backstories and designs.

226
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:11,842
There are also some who aspire to be singers and idols themselves.

227
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:13,659
So why are we supporting Sora?

228
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:18,019
What makes us put in all the effort to make a video about her, for this normal looking girl?

229
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,879
(Ending of Chu-Chu-Lu!)

230
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:34,042
Sora has been part of the Vtuber industry since 2017 and an idol since 2018.

231
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,400
She has been called by many names:

232
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,595
Tokino Sora

233
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:38,800
Sora-mama

234
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:40,000
Sora-neesan

235
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,695
Sora-senpai is an idol

236
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:44,387
Tokino Soda

237
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:48,626
But the core part of Sora’s identity is being a normal girl with a humble attitude,

238
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:51,867
a heartwarming personality, and a magnificent dream.

239
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:55,556
People naturally gravitate to Sora with her amazing singing talent,

240
00:17:55,556 --> 00:18:01,156
and for being an idol who talks to fans as if they are her family - even after becoming a celebrity.

241
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:03,848
While making this video, we decided to ask Soratomos:

242
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:06,479
Why do you root for Sora?

243
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,050
We had 73 responses to our poll.

244
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:13,694
The most frequent reason why Soratomos love Sora is because of her charming personality.

245
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:20,474
Soratomos see her as a relaxing, down to earth, polite and comforting dork, with a humble, positive and calm attitude.

246
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:24,611
Other reasons included her ability to sing, as well as her cuteness.

247
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:29,418
Many responses in Japanese noted that Sora’s singing makes them feel better.

248
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:37,060
By the time of this recording we are celebrating her reaching one million Youtube subscribers and her 5th anniversary.

249
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:42,905
We are rooting for her to realize her dream because it shows that even a normal girl can reach big heights.

250
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:45,698
She motivates us to push harder - even just a little,

251
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:51,353
and even a tweet from her saying we should take care of our health is enough to motivate a lot of people.

252
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:56,506
For us, she is a genuine and hardworking idol and we couldn't be any prouder of her achievements.

253
00:18:56,507 --> 00:19:01,355
We can't wait to see how much more she will accomplish to reach Yokohama Arena and beyond.

254
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:08,286
Sora is very soft spoken, but confident. She follows her own pace, and is considerate of others.

255
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:13,276
She will never deliberately overshadow anyone and will always support them as everyone supports her.

256
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:15,642
A firm pillar to many people.

257
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:19,864
She’s able to inspire them like a traditional idol and is always earnest to a fault.

258
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:25,501
The progress of Sora’s subscription count is often outpaced by her peers in the Vtuber industry.

259
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:31,081
One can say that her design in comparison may seem plain like water, but that in itself can be a good thing.

260
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:38,402
She will not force you to watch her, but instead she wants you to take care of yourself first both mentally and financially.

261
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:44,248
For her, any kind of support, such as watching her streams or drawing Sora art will make her happy.

262
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,856
Sora’s streams provide Soratomos a comfortable and warm vibe,

263
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:51,139
that even if we watch other Vtubers, she is watching with us.

264
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:54,644
When we watch Sora’s streams, she makes us feel like we are “coming home.”

265
00:19:56,804 --> 00:20:01,690
This is the end of our video of Tokino Sora’s journey, but she still has a long road ahead of her.

266
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,179
Her journey, which began as a high school girl Vtuber,

267
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:07,074
transformed her into the foundational pillar of Hololive,

268
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,176
and into the idol that we cheer for today,

269
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:12,152
supporting her to help her achieve her dreams..

270
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:15,699
When you are stressed or unmotivated, you can always count on Sora to brighten up your day

271
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,537
like the idol that she is.

272
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:19,740
She will give you the motivation to move.

273
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,804
Just remember,

274
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,118
to Step and Go.

275
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:28,756
(Step and Go)
